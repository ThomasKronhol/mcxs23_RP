    "text": "The question, objective and motivation\n\nResearch question\nCan Bayesian VARs and alternative data help better estimate the future state of household final consumption expenditures in Australia? Which combination of traditional and alternative data provides the highest accuracy in the latter indicator?\n\n\nObjective and Motivation\nAs it drives around 50% of the Australian GDP, Household Final Consumption Expenditures (PCE) is a leading indicator to gauge the economic health of a country. There is thus a high incentive to improve the accuracy of its predictions. This has encouraged researchers to investigate big data as alternative sources. For instance, Schimdt and Vosen (2011) use search query time-series provided by Google Trends to forecast consumption. Esteves (2009), Aprigliano, et al. (2019), Galbraith and Tkacz (2013), Carlsen and Storgaard (2010) analyze electronic payments to predict consumption as these can track a large percentage of spending activities. Ellingsen, et al. (2021) demonstrate that news media data capture information about consumption that hard economic indicators do not. Gil et al. (2018) investigate the potential of the Economic Policy Uncertainty index derived from news data and developed by Baker et al. (2016) to predict consumption.\nDespite the recognized superiority of Bayesian VARs in macroeconomic predictions, there is nearly no research on the combination of Bayesian VARs and alternative data. Existing articles either investigate the use of Bayesian estimation models or of alternative data to forecast indicators but do not consider both together.\nThis paper will compare the forecasts of PCE in Australia from Bayesian VARs and several extensions applied on different sets of variables. These datasets will include both traditional macroeconomic variables computed by statistical offices and alternative data such as Google Trends. This research project contributes to the literature by studying PCE, an indicator that has to date received scant attention from the Bayesian VARs literature. Moreover, it proposes the first investigation of the combination of Bayesian VARs with alternative data to forecast PCE."

    "text": "The data and their properties\nTo forecast PCE, we will construct a dataset which contains two types of variables: traditional macroeconomic indicators and alternative variables.\nThe traditional variables included in this analysis were collected from the readrba package and will be:\n\nHousehold final consumption expenditure\nReal household disposable income\nConsumer sentiment indicator\nConsumer Price Index\n\nIncorporating traditional economic variables along alternative data in this exercise is important as we do not want to fall in the “Big Data hubris” trap introduced by (Lazer et al., 2014). The “Big Data Hubris” is the problematic assumption that alternative data or big data can be used as a replacement for traditional data rather than a supplement. To prevent this, combining non-standard and standard variables together can lead to greater value. Moreover, previous extensive literature already has recognized the predictive power of these macroeconomic variables.\n\nFigure 1. Time series plots of the variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the alternative data, a Google Trends index will be included. Google Trends is a tool which reveals how frequently a certain keyword has been searched for on the Google web browser. The platform provides weekly aggregated time series starting in 2004 for a specific keyword that can be directly downloaded using the R package “gtrendsR”. The Google Trends index will be constructed based on the methodology presented in Schmidt and Vosen (2009). However, we will adapt their approach to match Australian specifies. Therefore, the specific keywords to construct the index have yet to be chosen. Moreover, Google Trends have been quite extensively studied to forecast labor market indicators but only a few articles have focused on PCE."

Moreover, we will estimate the matrix A to understand the relationship between those variables. The objective will be to identify whether alternative data can improve the forecast accuracy of PCE."
